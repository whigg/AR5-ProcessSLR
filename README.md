# AR5-ProcessSLR
An "AR5-esque" process-based sea-level rise model. Optimized for fast sampling over parameter space and with a modular structure that allows for easy testing of different parameterizations.

# TODO:
 - Add functions.py file
 - Implement the existing, messy code in one class, where you can initialize the model with different constants and closures
